Rules for Content Structure:
1. Maintain Existing Format
   - Keep the exact table structure for papers: | Name | Description | Paper | Code |
   - Keep the list format for tools and products: - [Name](link) - Description [⭐Stars]
   - Preserve all existing sections and their hierarchy
   - Keep the table headers and alignment exactly as they are

2. Content Organization
   - Place papers in appropriate paper sections (Survey, LLM-Driven, Robotics, etc.)
   - Place tools in the Open Source Projects section
   - Place products in the Companies & Products section
   - Create new subsections only if truly needed

3. Quality Standards
   - Each entry must be directly related to Embodied AI
   - Papers must have either arxiv/doi links or GitHub implementations
   - Tools must have active GitHub repositories
   - Descriptions should be technical and concise

4. When Merging Content
   - Add new high-impact content in the appropriate sections
   - Keep entries organized alphabetically within sections
   - Remove outdated or less relevant content
   - Preserve foundational papers and tools
   - Maintain table alignment and formatting

5. Content Format Examples:
   Paper entry:
   | GPT4V | MLM(Image+Language->Language) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) | |

   Tool entry:
   - [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) - NVIDIA's robotics simulator with photorealistic rendering [⭐5000]

Remember: The goal is to maintain a valuable, well-organized list that serves the Embodied AI community. Preserve the exact formatting while ensuring high-quality content."""
